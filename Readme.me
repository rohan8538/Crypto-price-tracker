Mini Project that shows real time market details of various cryptocurrency using API from coingeko.com. The project is based on react. Its a really simple one and good for college students to begin with. Thanx for visiting here and happy learning.

While there's not much to explain but do read a bit about axios, async functions, states, npm, and material UI before beginning with this project. The basic progamming knowledge of Javascript, react, css, HTML and Node is also important to get along with the project.

I haven't optimised it for being responsive to different scren size. So the contents might get out of your mobile screen. Thats just needs to be done using CSS. I would be thankful if you could sort them out for me. Or else just clone this repo to your local and play.

HAPPY LEARNING.
